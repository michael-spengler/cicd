# Deno Module for Continuous Deployment

## Usage Example 
Setup a GitHub Actions based workflow from which you call the features of the CICD module.  
To do so: copy & paste e.g. the content of [.github/workflows/release.yml](https://github.com/michael-spengler/cicd/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml) to your repo.  

To explore all examples check the [.github/workflows/](https://github.com/michael-spengler/cicd/tree/main/.github/workflows) folder.
